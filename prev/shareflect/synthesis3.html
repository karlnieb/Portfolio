					<h3>03 Personas</h3>
					<p>After conducting research we realized that we needed two personas to help us fully focus our design.</p>
					
					<h4>Persona 1: Justin Branch</h4>
					<p>Justin Branch is a 21-year-old college senior at Columbia University in Manhatten. He is a psychology major. He is originally from California and calls himself a surfer at heart. </p>
					<p>He loves photography. He discovered his passion for photography his first year  at school. It was fall and all the leaves on the trees starting to turn these  amazing colors, unlike anything he had seen on the west coast. Now, he takes pictures of all sorts of things, nature,  life in the big city, going out with friends.</p>
					<p>He takes  pride in hearing his friends appreciate and comment on his pictures. He  likes the way it makes him feel when people tell him how excited they feel that  he has captured those awesome college moments.</p>

					<p><img src="images/persona/Justin2.jpg" alt="JustinPhoto" width="200" height="148"></p>
					<h5>Life Goals</h5>
					<p>Justin's life goals are to grow and foster his friendships by remembering fun experiences they've had together. He imagines one day recounting his bachelor days to his grandchildren and would like to have good collections of pictures to help preserve his memories.</p>
					<h5>End Goals</h5>
					<p>Justin's end goals are:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>to share his pictures with his friends</li>
				      <li>to be able to revisit his pictures to remember events</li>
				      <li>to feel appreciated by his friends for his efforts</li>
				  </ul>
					<h4>Persona 2: Ren&eacute;e Aldridge</h4>
					<p>Ren&eacute;e Aldridge is also a 21-year-old college senior at Columbia University. She is a psychology major and plays for the college soccer team. </p>
					<p>Her parents recently gave her a new camera for her twenty-first birthday but she only uses it occasionally. She feels that taking pictures takes her out of the moment. She usually just hands over her camera to a friend to take pictures.</p>
					<p>Ren&eacute;e loves looking at pictures of events and she is so glad that she has friends who do take pictures, like Justin Branch. She also loves commenting on pictures on Facebook, especially to highlight funny moments.</p>
					<p>She would like to have a place where she add  her pictures when she does take them and also augment her own collection with  others&rsquo; pictures. She  does want to have a good collection of events and random pix from her college  experience, like her team matches, going out with friend and such.</p>

					<p><img src="images/persona/Renee2.jpg" alt="Renee Socer" width="400" height="268"></p>
					<h5>Life Goals</h5>
					<p>Ren&eacute;e's life goals are to keep in touch with her friends and foster a feeling of group cohesion and identity.</p>
					<h5>End Goals</h5>
					<p>Ren&eacute;e's end goals are:</p>
					<ul>
                      <li>to have a collection of shared memories with her friends</li>
					  <li>to be able to document stories that have happened </li>
					  <li>to comment on pictures</li>
				  </ul>
