				<h2>Research</h2>
				  <h3>02 Directed Storytelling</h3>
					<h4>Goals</h4>
					<p>The goals of conducting directed storytelling was to gain a better understanding of how people remember group events. We tried to gain an understanding of why, what, and how people remembered experiences in order to uncover user needs and motivations.</p>
					<h4>Results</h4>
				  <p>We conducted face-to-face directed storytelling with 3 people who were attending a happy hour event with  graduate students from their department. We collected detailed <a href="documents/UserResearchNotes.pdf">notes</a> and extracted  key points which are presented below.</p>
					
				  <h5>Pride in collecting</h5>
					<p>Individuals who took pictures of events or saved mementos from events took pride in their effort. They enjoyed the fact that their friends would appreciate their efforts as well.
				  <h5>Need for privacy</h5>
					<p>People enjoyed having pictures taken but they wanted to be able to have some editing control over what would be shared with others.</p>
					
				  <h5>Remember memorable happenings </h5>
					<p>Salient events, especially funny or happy stories, were the most remembered. These created a sense of group cohesion and identity and were often accompanied with positive emotions. People were happy to recall funny little vignettes or jokes..</p>
