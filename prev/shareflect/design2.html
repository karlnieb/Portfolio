				<h2>Design</h2>
				<h3>02 Scenarios</h3>
					<p>We explored several different scenarios to guide our design. Because we have two personas, we illustrate two different ways the site could be used via our two personas.</p>
					<h4>Justin's Scenario</h4>
					<p>Justin is visiting Shareflect in order to upload some pictures from a recent experience. Specifically, he took a lot of pictures at a happy hour with his fellow Psychology classmates last Friday. Once he’s logged on to Shareflect, he is taken to his group’s page. He clicks on his Psych group and is ready to add an event. A window pops open that allows him to input information about the happy hour and also takes him through the upload process. At this point he can upload a variety of multi-media, including audio clips, photos, and videos. </p>
					<p>Justin revisits the site a few days later to check to see if any of his friends have commented on the photos from the happy hour. He really enjoys this part because it makes happy that people appreciate his photos. The stories and comments on the site are usually really funny and he appreciates the fact that people take the time to recount them. </p>

					<h4>Ren&eacute;e's Scenario</h4>
					<p>Ren&eacute;e is visiting Shareflect to check out the pictures Justin has just uploaded. She had a lot of fun at the happy hour and can’t wait to see if any embarrassing ones made it to the collection. She goes to her Psych group on Shareflect and peruses the photos. She sees a few that remind her of a funny story that happened and decides to add it to the site. She clicks in the add comment text area , types in her story, and hits submit. The page reloads with her saved story.  Ren&eacute;e  can’t wait to see how others respond!</p>
