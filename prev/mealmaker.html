                <p><br/>When assigned to design an interactive kiosk for a public space, we brainstormed different locations where we might be able to add to the experience with technology, such as waiting at the airport or visiting Pittsburgh's cultural Strip District during a busy Saturday morning. However, we quickly found that the grocery store experience had a lot of potential for improvement, especially as it's something everybody has to deal with. We used needs validation, a type of "speed dating," to quickly get feedback on a range different concepts and narrow down. The idea of contextual recipes was instantly understandable for people and could be found either by scanning a specific ingredient or by seeing a suggestion (relative to its location in the store) as you walk by. This concept also has real business value, as it encourages shoppers to explore new foods and also to buy the additional ingredients for a recipe while they are still at the store. In our scenario, the Meal Maker helps Andy learn to cook and Jill to use fresh, seasonal ingredients in a tasty dish.</p>
