            	<h2>Apply Contextual Design methods to redesign a collaborative shopping system for small groups.</h2>
				<img src="images/getit5.png"/>
                <p>Using Contextual Inquiry, Heuristic Evaluation, Keystroke-Level Modelling, Cognitive Walkthrough, and Think Aloud, my team designed a system to enable collaborative shopping on the web.</p>
                <img src="images/getit3.png"/>
                <p>We spent a lot of time analyzing existing systems, such as Craigslist, and why they don't support the task of collaborative shopping effectively.</p>
                <img src="images/getit4.png"/>
                <p>We brainstormed many ideas and metaphors that could give us a different perspective on shopping together. My one requirement was that our system had to be better than a pad of paper to pass notes with. I think we succeeded.</p>	
                <img src="images/getit2.png"/>
                <p>Our final design was inspired by a talk with our professor <a href="http://www.design.cmu.edu/show_person.php?t=f&id=JohnZimmerman">John Zimmerman</a>, who turned us away from a mechanical voting-type system and asked us to consider the human needs of our users, such as bonding and joking around. The design acts as a virtual whiteboard where groupmembers can add and move items around to show preference and write comments to have natural discussions (and witty banter) about the decision.</p>
                <img src="images/getit6.png"/>
                <p>Even before we were done, we knew we had a winner when we had a blast using the prototype system to make a group decision on where to go for lunch. We got an A+.</p>
