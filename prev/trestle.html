            	<h2>Redesign an online course platform to improve student experience and productivity.</h2>
                <img src="images/trestle2.png"/>
                <p>This was my first major project to use Contextual Design from start to finish. Our client wanted to come up with a completely new design for Trestle, an online course platform used around the world, and we agreed to focus specifically on improving students' experience and productivity with the site.</p>
				<img src="images/trestle3.png"/>
                <p>I performed Contextual Inquiries (CIs) of two students in their natural places of work: one online student logged on to her course in a coffee shop to watch recorded lectures, and a Carnegie Mellon student worked on her homework in a campus computer lab.</p>
				<img src="images/trestle6.png"/>
                <p>We ended up performing the most CIs in the class. We learned to be efficient; in one week, we performed and modelled five different CIs. Then, we consolidated all our research in another week. It was a hectic time.</p>

                <p>After being elected design lead by the group, I created paper prototypes that we used for Cognitive Walkthrough, Keystroke-Level Modeling, and Think Aloud to assess usability.</p>
				<img src="images/trestle4.png"/>
                <p>With the feedback from the usability tests, I led group discussions to get everybody's input for the final design. I created and delivered the final wireframes to the client along with a document explaining the new design, linking each feature to the findings from our research.</p>
