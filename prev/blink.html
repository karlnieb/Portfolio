                <p>As design lead, I strive to incorporate human-centered methods from the Design department with the Contextual Design process we are taught in HCI. In the beginning, everybody had a different idea of what the problem looked like, so I had the team create a territory map to get on the same page.</p>
                <img src="images/fluency3.png"/>
                <p>Before our Contextual Inquiries (CIs) were arranged for field research, I wanted to keep the group busy with other exploratory research. We conducted Heuristic Evaluations of natural language systems on the web to find out what was currently being done wellâ€“and what wasn't.</p>
                <img src="images/fluency4.png"/>
                <p>When our CIs got underway, we focused on looking for similarities between the different user groups of Salesforce. I think it pays to stay broad in the beginning until you get a little information about the situation, or you may miss something important.</p>
                <img src="images/fluency6.png"/>
                <p>After two CIs it was apparent that it would not be feasible to design for multiple user groups with our time constraints, and we narrowed our focus for future research. A solution can be designed for a specific user group while being extensible to others.</p>
                <img src="images/fluency5.png"/>
                <p>We are now compiling our research from the spring semester, and will be designing and developing a working prototype to deliver to Salesforce as we go full-time on the project over the summer.</p>
