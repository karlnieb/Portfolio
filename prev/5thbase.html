                <p>We began talking about how to help people find the jobs that make them happiest, and I suggested that we could use dating as a metaphor for this type of job search process.</p>
                <img src="images/5thbase2.png"/>
                <p>The group then decided to focus specifically on networking, and I felt that since current networking institutions (job fairs, mixers) often feel a little artificial, we should come up with a more natural way to facilitate meeting interesting people and making useful career connections.</p>

                <p>Our "wingman" research idea put a hired actress as the agent of a woman looking to meet guys she might like to date. I talked with the participants afterwards to learn what strategies they used to communicate and find out how the actress was able to get such a good idea of the woman's preferences in such a short time.</p>
                <img src="images/5thbase6.png"/>
                <p>Research is finished and we are developing and refining a concept. Our current idea is to create a personal networking tool that incorporates the specific insights we learned from our exploratory and generative research.</p>
